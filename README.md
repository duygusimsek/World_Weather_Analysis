# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

### History of the Project

The purpose of the previous analysis was how to provide real-time suggestions for the PlanMyTrip app.’s clients’ preferences of hotels. For that goal, 1500 pairs of latitudes and longitudes had chosen randomly and identified 201 cities from the coordinates. Those cities’ weather data were retrieved based on clients’ weather preferences. 

Based on the data temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed were compared to latitude; and for these categories, a series of heatmaps were created. And finally, a heatmap with pop-up markers, which displays information about the city’s current max. temperature and a hotel in the city were generated. 

### Purpose of the Analysis

The previous analysis of weather data was increased to 2000 randomly selected pairs of latitudes and longitudes and identified 702 cities from the coordinates, and current weather description data was added to the dataset. For the clients of the PlanMyTrip app. input statements were provided for their weather preferences, which were used for identification of potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 

Four cities had been chosen from the potential travel destination list and a travel itinerary was created. By using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between those four cities was generated and marked with information pop-up markers. 

## Results

* **Weather Database**

2000 randomly chosen pairs of latitudes and longitudes and 702 cities were identified from these coordinates. For each city’s information of latitudes & longitudes, max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, weather description, and the country of the city were retrieved by using the “citipy API”.  A data frame was created and exported to a CSV file.

* **Vacation Search** 

The CSV file for the weather database was used as a resource.  Input statements for clients’ preferences were provided. With the input preferences of max. and min. temperature,  and after dropping the null data cities narrowed down to 274. For each city, the nearby hotels were found by using the “gmaps API”. A data frame was created and exported to a CSV file.

A marker layer map with pop-up markers for each city for the vacation search was created and uploaded. [WeatherPy_vacation_map.png](https://github.com/duygusimsek/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation_map.png)


* **Vacation Itinerary**

Four cities were chosen and a travel itinerary was created and a travel route was generated by using the Google Maps Directions API. [WeatherPy_travel_map.png](https://github.com/duygusimsek/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Vacation_Itinerary/WeatherPy_travel_map.png)

Finally, a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for the four cities on the itinerary was generated. Each marker has information about the city name and country, a nearby hotel, and a current weather description. The layer map was uploaded.
